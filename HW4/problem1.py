    NOTE: For better readability of the instructions, 
          please turn on the 'Word Wrap' setting in your editor. 
    HOW: For example, in the VS Code editor, click "Settings" in the menu, 
         then type "word wrap" in the search box of the settings, 
    choose "on" in the drop-down menu.
    TEST: If you can read this long sentence without scrolling your screen from left to right, it means that your editor's word wrap setting is on and you are good to go.

def Terms_and_Conditions():
    ''' 
      By submitting this homework or changing this function, you agree with the following terms:
       (1) Not sharing your code/solution with any student before and after the homework due. For example, sending your code segment to another student, putting your solution online or lending your laptop (if your laptop contains your solution or your Dropbox automatically copied your solution from your desktop computer to your laptop) to another student to work on this homework will violate this term.
       (2) Not using anyone's code in this homework and building your own solution. For example, using some code segments from another student or online resources due to any reason (like too busy recently) will violate this term. Changing other's code as your solution (such as changing the variable names) will also violate this term.
       (3) When discussing with any other students about this homework, only discuss high-level ideas or use pseudo-code. Don't discuss about the solution at the code level. For example, two students discuss about the solution of a function (which needs 5 lines of code to solve) and they then work on the solution "independently", however the code of the two solutions are exactly the same, or only with minor differences (variable names are different). In this case, the two students violate this term.
      All violations of (1),(2) or (3) will be handled in accordance with the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.  For more details, please visit: https://www.wpi.edu/about/policies/academic-integrity/dishonesty
      Note: We may use the Stanford Moss system to check your code for code similarity. https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/moss/
      Historical Data: In one year, we ended up finding 25% of the students in that class violating one of the above terms and we handled ALL of these violations according to the WPI Academic Honesty Policy.

	 0, 4 
 the inverse matrix Xi of X is, 
	 1/2,  0 
	  0 , 1/4 
 So, when we compute the matrix multiplication X Xi, we get an identity matrix I:

	 1, 2 
	 3, 4 
 the inverse matrix Xi of X is,
